                        Apples should be kept in a cool space away from sunlight and heat. Depending on the variety, they will keep in a cool space for up to two weeks. When refrigerated, most apples will keep for 3–4 weeks.

To ripen avocados faster, put them in a paper bag for a couple of days. After ripening, they may be refrigerated for several days, and half-avocados should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge with the pit still in place (to limit browning).

If purchased from the farmers market and they're in a brown paper bag, just transfer them to an airtight container or zip-top bag.

                    <p>5-7 days<br>Grapes should be stored in the refrigerator, unwashed and dry, and kept on their stems (rather than loose). Wash them in cold water just before eating. If you rinse grapes before putting them in the fridge, they’ll only last a few days—since even a tiny amount of moisture will encourage bacteria growth, as will the exposed area left behind by the stem. Dry, refrigerated grapes on the stem can last up to two weeks. You can also freeze washed single grapes and eat them like little popsicle treats.

                    <p>5-7 days<br>Store unripe and ripened kiwifruit at 32–35 degrees Fahrenheit. To ripen, hold fruit at room temperature in a loosely closed paper bag, for two to three days and avoid unusual heat and direct sunlight. Once kiwifruit is ripe and yields to the touch, it should be refrigerated until ready for use. Do not store kiwifruit near other ethylene producing fruits (apples, avocados, bananas, pears, tomatoes) which can trigger further ripening.<br>Ripe kiwifruit will last five to ten days in refrigeration. Very firm kiwifruit can be kept in the refrigerator for up to one month.

                    <p>7-10 days<br>Store melons at room temperature until ripe. The best indicator of melon ripeness is the aroma. If a melon’s sweet fragrance is noticeable, it’s probably ready to cut and eat. The outside of the melon should feel firm but give slightly to pressure, particularly on the end where the stem was. If it feels rock-hard, give it a little more time. Wash thoroughly before cutting. Once cut, remove seeds by scooping them out with a spoon, cover and refrigerate.

The FruitGuys strives to deliver them to you on the firm side so they won’t be damaged in shipping. To speed nectarine ripening, place them in a paper bag on the counter. When they’ve reached the desired ripeness, wash and eat. You can also refrigerate ripe nectarines for up to several days.
